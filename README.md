# Global COVID-19 Vaccination Rank History

These visualizations illustrate global COVID-19 vaccine total doses administered per 100 people rank percentile by date for all countries in OWID data. Rank percentile captures rank independent of country count which increases with time. 

Also includes a linear regression trendline that shows countries dose administration trend over its administration history.

The visualization also includes sorting countries by country name, trend, total doses administered, population, date.

Note: 

Creating rank history required 'filling up' missing values from last available past value for days where a country does not have data available. This often occurs over weekends, or other various reasons where a country data has missing data.

Rank percentile is based on global rank, not the actual total or daily dose value
